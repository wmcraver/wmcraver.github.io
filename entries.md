### Daily Entries

**Day 1**

I wasn't really planning on making today _Day 1_, but figured today is as good as any day to begin.  For my first day, I decided to go back to the basics.  I went to [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org) and started reading the docs from the beginning.  Most of it was a refresher, but I quickly realized that most of the content from YouTube videos and some books that I've read are really from the [Getting Started with Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) guide.  I'm a little frustrated that I spent money on a book that regurgitates the guides.  The book that I bought wasn't all bad, it took me through a slightly more advanced tutorial with a lot of bells and whistles.  However, I found that the Rails Guides described the content so much better.  Great job to those writers!
