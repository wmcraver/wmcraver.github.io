### Daily Entries

**Day 3**

Day three and almost no progress.  Today was my birthday and I had a lot going on at work.  Then, we went to a baseball game for the evening.  While I was at work on lunch, I read about rails templates that allow you to specify options for new rails applications.  Pretty cool.  Hopefully tomorrow will go better and I will be able to create something.


**Day 2**

Today I read some other guides on models and CRUD operations.  I didn't learn too much that I didn't already know, but being able to pull it from memory is not possible yet. While thinking of other apps, I wanted to know the best way to keep a log of changes that were made to records in the model.  For instance, when a record is updated, I wanted to keep a log of what changed.  I found that you can use [ActiveModel::Dirty](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Dirty.html) to keep track of the changes before they are committed to the model. Tomorrow, I think I will try to build a basic web app just to stretch my limited muscle memory.


**Day 1**

I wasn't really planning on making today _Day 1_, but figured today is as good as any day to begin.  For my first day, I decided to go back to the basics.  I went to [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org) and started reading the docs from the beginning.  Most of it was a refresher, but I quickly realized that most of the content from YouTube videos and some books that I've read are really from the [Getting Started with Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) guide.  I'm a little frustrated that I spent money on a book that regurgitates the guides.  The book that I bought wasn't all bad, it took me through a slightly more advanced tutorial with a lot of bells and whistles.  However, I found that the Rails Guides described the content so much better.  Great job to those writers!
