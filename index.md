## My 30 day Rails Challenge
I've been trying to learn Rails on and off for a few months.  I've read some books, watched a ton of Youtube videos, joined some developer forums for new Rails programmers, and read countless blog posts and articles.  I created some basic web apps (yep, even the infamous blog), but haven't devoted enough consistent learning to go much further.  That said, I'm doing a personal 30 day challenge to push myself to deepen my learning.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/wmcraver/wmcraver.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
