## My 60 day Rails Challenge
I've been trying to learn Rails on and off for a few months.  I've read some books, watched a ton of Youtube videos, joined some developer forums for new Rails programmers, and read countless blog posts and articles.  I created some basic web apps (yep, even the infamous blog), but haven't devoted enough consistent learning to go much further.  That's where I'm introducing my 60 day challenge.

The first 30 days will be dedicated to consuming as much information as I can and building a few simple web applications as I can to gain a better foundational understanding of Rails.  The second 30 days, will be devoted to creating a web app.  What web app?  That's a great question.  One that I will figure this out in the first 30 days.

My plan is to perform a daily update via an entry on this site to document my journey.
